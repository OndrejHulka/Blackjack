# Blackjack Game – OOP Practice with Tkinter  

## Overview  
This is a simple Blackjack game implemented in Python to practice Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The game includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, making it more interactive and user-friendly.  

## Features  
**Card Deck Simulation** – Uses a shuffled deck of cards to mimic real Blackjack gameplay.  
**Object-Oriented Structure** – Implements classes for the deck, player, and dealer to reinforce OOP principles.  
**Graphical Interface with Tkinter** – Provides a basic UI for card dealing, hitting, and standing.  
**Game Logic** – Handles player and dealer actions, determines wins/losses, and follows standard Blackjack rules.  

## Technologies Used 
- **Python** – Core programming language.  
- **Tkinter** – For GUI implementation.  
- **Random Module** – To shuffle the deck.  

## Future Improvements  
- Implement betting system.  
- Add animations for card dealing.  
- Improve UI design with custom styling.
